# Mini Project 3
1. In order to run the codes smoothly, please use the correct path to the training folder directory.
	- The training data is in the folder named "Data".

2. Since experimentation 2.4 and 2.5 are Keras DNN, please change the path to the directory of the best_model1/2/3
	- best_model1/2/3 are saved in the folder named "Keras DNN Best Models (for 2.4 and 2.5)".
	- Caution: For 2.5, it could take up to an hour to run the whole script if you don't run it with dedicated GPU.

3. This is an exploratory work and it needs a lot of further works to improve it, so please do let me know about your comments and suggestions by contacting me at:
